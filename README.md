## Good extentions to install

There are good extentions for js, vue and vite. The vite one is particularly good because it will automaticly run the vite server on launch and has an integrated browser

To install all the node packages needed after cloning this repo or pulling make sure to run `npm install` to make sure all node packages are up to date
